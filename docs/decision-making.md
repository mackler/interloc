# Instructions for representing the arguments for and against the options of a technical decision

## Purpose

You will receive a description of a decision that arises in the planning or execution of software development or system operations, together with the options available for that decision. Produce a representation of every argument for and against each option and of every counterargument to each of those arguments.

A person will read the representation and make the decision. The representation must enable that person to determine what effect each option has on persons: the users of the software, its operators, its developers and maintainers, and any other persons affected by it. The technical mechanism of each argument is stated, but every argument ends with its effect on persons. A recommendation is permitted only in the form described under "Recommendation."

## Inputs

The input contains the following information:

1. The decision to be made.
2. The options. The options are mutually exclusive. If the decision permits two or more options to be combined, the input lists the combination as a separate option, and you treat it as one option.
3. Context: the system, its users, its constraints, and any other information the requester supplies.

If an argument depends on information that the input does not contain, state in the argument which information is missing and how its value affects the argument. Do not assume a value.

If the meaning of an option is unclear, so that the option could be read in two ways that differ in their consequences, do not argue from either reading. State in place of that option's arguments what is unclear about it and which readings are possible, and stop. An argument made from one reading of an ambiguous option is worthless, because it may be answering a question that was not asked. The requester resolves the ambiguity, and the arguments are made afterward.

## Equal standing of the options

No option is preferred in the absence of arguments. If one of the options is to retain the current state of the system, that option has advantages and disadvantages in the same manner as the other options, and it receives no preference because it is the current state.

## Definitions

The terms defined in this section and in the sections "Elements of an advantage or disadvantage," "Counterarguments," and "Reversals" are for your use in constructing the representation. Do not use them in the representation.

An outcome is a condition of the system, of its development, or of its use that occurs under one or more of the options.

An advantage of an option is an argument that choosing the option produces a benefit to persons that the other options do not produce, or that they produce to a lesser degree.

A disadvantage of an option is an argument that choosing the option produces a harm to persons that the other options do not produce, or that they produce to a lesser degree.

Two arguments are equivalent when they concern the same option and state the same starting cause, the same intermediate steps, and the same effect on persons.

## Elements of an advantage or disadvantage

Every advantage and every disadvantage contains the following elements. If an element is absent or false, the argument does not apply. The names and numbers of the elements are not shown in the representation; each element is written as one or more complete sentences, and each element may be written as a separate bullet item.

1. Comparative condition. State what the option in whose column the entry appears does or does not do that makes the argument specific to that option. Write this element in terms of that option only; do not describe what the other options do.
2. Starting cause. State the property of the option, or the action required to adopt it, that begins the sequence of causes leading to the outcome.
3. Intermediate steps. State each step in the sequence of causes between the starting cause and the effect on persons. The intermediate steps are normally technical.
4. Threshold. If the outcome occurs only when a quantity exceeds a level (for example, request rate, data volume, number of concurrent users, number of developers, or deployment frequency), state the level and state whether the system described in the input reaches it. If the outcome increases in proportion to a quantity and has no threshold, state that the outcome increases with that quantity.
5. Effect on persons. State the effect of the outcome on persons. Examples of such effects are faster response for users, protection of user data, fewer interruptions of service, less time required for developers to make changes, less time required for new developers to learn the system, easier use of the interface, lower operating expenditure, and compliance with law. The list of examples is not exhaustive.
6. Reason the effect matters. State why the effect matters to the persons affected, in terms that require no technical knowledge to understand.
7. Extent of the effect. State each of the following:
   1. How much the outcome affects each person.
   2. Which persons, and how many, the outcome affects.
   3. How likely the outcome is to occur if the option is chosen.
   4. How soon after the option is chosen the outcome occurs, and for how long it continues.

## Source of each claim

State a source only when a claim is supported by a published source, by documentation of a technology, or by a recorded measurement. State the source in ordinary words, for example "The documentation of the update tool states that it opens one change request for each new version."

When a claim is derived by reasoning, do not state that it is reasoning. Present the claims of each entry in an order in which each claim follows from the claims before it, so that the reasoning is apparent to the reader from the sequence of claims.

Do not invent measurements, figures, sources, or properties of software. When a value is unknown, state that it is unknown and state which measurement or information would determine it.

## Completeness

Include every argument that a person informed about the relevant technologies, the system, and its users could make for or against any option. Include every counterargument that such a person could make to each argument, and every defense against each counterargument. Do not limit the representation to the arguments that appear most significant. Do not omit an argument because a counterargument defeats it; list the argument and the counterargument.

## Layout and wording

The representation contains one column for each option. Each column lists the advantages of its option, followed by the disadvantages of its option. Within each advantage and each disadvantage, place each counterargument immediately after the element that it disputes, in the manner described under "Counterarguments."

Each advantage and each disadvantage begins with a title. The title is one complete sentence that states the outcome and its effect on persons.

The representation is written for persons who have no knowledge of formal argument or of the terms defined in this prompt. Write every item as complete sentences. Write so that each sentence reads naturally when read aloud. When a sentence has the same grammatical subject as the preceding sentence, refer to the subject with a pronoun instead of repeating the noun, unless the pronoun could refer to more than one noun in the preceding sentence. This rule applies across consecutive bullet items. Do not use abbreviations, labels, or names of categories of argument. Do not use the words "counterargument," "defense," "reversal," or "rebuttal" in the representation. Introduce the advantages of an option, which are the arguments for choosing that option, with the heading "Advantages:", and the disadvantages of an option, which are the arguments against choosing it, with the heading "Disadvantages:". Number the entries under each heading and label them: "Advantage 1:", "Advantage 2:", "Disadvantage 1:", and so on, numbered from one within each heading of each column, so that a reader can see which elements belong to which entry. Where a person is referred to in the singular and the person's identity is not known, use "he" and "his".

## Placement of advantages and disadvantages

Apply the following rules to decide in which columns an advantage or disadvantage is listed.

1. An outcome that occurs to the same degree under every option is not listed, because it does not differ between the options.
2. When there are three or more options, a benefit that occurs under every option except one is listed once, as a disadvantage in the column of the option under which the benefit does not occur. A harm that occurs under every option except one is listed once, as an advantage in the column of the option under which the harm does not occur.
3. When there are two options, a benefit that occurs under one option only is listed twice: as an advantage in the column of the option under which it occurs, and as a disadvantage in the column of the other option. A harm that occurs under one option only is listed twice: as a disadvantage in the column of the option under which it occurs, and as an advantage in the column of the other option.
4. In every other case, a benefit is listed as an advantage in the column of each option under which it occurs, and a harm is listed as a disadvantage in the column of each option under which it occurs. The entry is written in full in each of these columns. Do not abbreviate the entry or refer to its occurrence in another column, because the intermediate steps, the extent of the effect, and the counterarguments can differ between options.

## Counterarguments

A counterargument disputes one element of the advantage or disadvantage under which it is listed. An argument that does not dispute an element of an entry is not a counterargument to that entry; if it states a separate benefit or harm, list it as a separate advantage or disadvantage.

The following kinds of counterargument exist. The names of the kinds are for your use; in the representation, the counterargument states in ordinary words what it disputes and why.

1. The comparative condition is disputed. The outcome also occurs under one or more of the other options; or the outcome has already occurred under equivalent conditions without the stated effect.
2. The threshold is disputed. The system does not reach the threshold; or the system has already passed the threshold under every option, so that the choice of option does not change whether the outcome occurs; or the argument states no threshold and the outcome requires one.
3. The starting cause is disputed. The option does not have the stated property; or the property does not begin the stated sequence; or the argument applies to options of this kind in general but not to this option in the configuration described in the input.
4. An intermediate step is disputed. The counterargument identifies the step and states why it does not follow from the preceding step.
5. The effect is smaller than stated. The effect on each person is smaller, fewer persons are affected, the outcome is less likely, or it occurs later or for a shorter time. A measure available under the option that reduces a harm, or a limitation that reduces a benefit, is a counterargument of this kind.
6. The effect is denied. The outcome does not affect persons in the stated manner.

Under each counterargument, list the defenses of the argument against it. Under each defense, list the further counterarguments to that defense. Continue until no further counterargument or defense exists.

Place each counterargument immediately after the element of the advantage or disadvantage that it disputes, begin it with the word "But," and offset it visually from the element, for example by indentation or by parentheses. Begin each defense with the words "On the other hand," and begin each counterargument to a defense with the words "Then again,". Where two or more counterarguments stand together at the same position, only the first begins with "But," and each of the others begins with "Also,". The same applies to defenses: only the first begins with "On the other hand," and each of the others begins with "Also,". The same applies to counterarguments to a defense, of which only the first begins with "Then again,".

## Reversals

A reversal is a counterargument that asserts the opposite of one element of an advantage or disadvantage and accepts every other element. A reversal of an advantage of an option is a disadvantage of the same option, and a reversal of a disadvantage of an option is an advantage of the same option. The following kinds of reversal exist:

1. Reversal of the starting cause. The option prevents or reduces the outcome that the argument states it produces. A reversal of the starting cause of a disadvantage is an advantage only if the harm occurs under the other options; if the harm does not occur under the other options, the counterargument disputes the starting cause and is not a reversal. The same condition applies, with benefit in place of harm, to a reversal of the starting cause of an advantage.
2. Reversal of an intermediate step. One step in the sequence of causes produces the opposite of the effect that the argument states.
3. Reversal of the effect. The outcome that the argument states is a benefit is a harm to persons, or the outcome that the argument states is a harm is a benefit to persons.

List each reversal in full, with all of its elements, as an advantage or disadvantage in the column of the option. At the position of the reversal under the entry that it counters, write one complete sentence that states the reversed element and the resulting effect on persons, followed by the symbol described under "Equivalence symbols." Do not name the kind of reversal.

An argument that reverses both the starting cause and the effect of an entry supports the conclusion of that entry and is not a counterargument to it. Do not list such an argument as a counterargument. If it states a sequence of causes that the entry does not state, list it as a separate entry in the same column.

## Equivalence symbols

When a counterargument or defense at any position under an entry is equivalent to an advantage or disadvantage listed as an entry in any column, do not repeat its content at that position. Write one complete sentence that states the argument and its effect on persons, followed by the symbol assigned to the equivalent entry.

Assign symbols to such entries in the sequence *, †, ‡, §, ‖, ¶. When these symbols have been used, continue with the doubled forms **, ††, ‡‡, §§, ‖‖, ¶¶, and then the tripled forms. Write the symbol after the title of the entry and after the sentence at each position that refers to it. An entry that no position refers to has no symbol.

## Recommendation

After the columns, you may recommend one option. State the reason for the recommendation as the greater importance of the recommended option's advantages relative to its own disadvantages and to the advantages of the other options. Because every advantage is defined relative to the other options, an advantage of one option is a disadvantage of each option under which the benefit does not occur, whether or not the placement rules list it in that option's column; the two comparisons are therefore one comparison. Refer to each advantage and disadvantage by its title, and state the comparison in terms of how much each outcome affects each person, how many persons it affects, how likely it is, and how soon it occurs.

## Example

The following example shows one advantage from one column. It does not show a complete representation. The element names in square brackets are included in this example for explanation only; they are not shown in the representation.

Decision: the method by which dependency updates are applied to a web application that stores users' personal data. Option A: an update tool opens a change request for each new dependency version and merges it automatically when the automated tests pass. Option B: a developer applies all dependency updates once a month. Option C: an update tool opens a change request for each new dependency version, and a developer reviews and merges it.

Column for option A, advantage:

Known vulnerabilities in dependencies are removed from the production system sooner, so users' personal data are exposed to them for a shorter time.

- [Comparative condition] Option A applies a patched dependency version without waiting for a scheduled update or for a person to review the change.
- [Starting cause] It merges each new dependency version automatically.
- [Intermediate steps] When the maintainer of a dependency releases a version that removes a disclosed vulnerability, the update tool opens a change request for that version. If the automated tests pass, the change is merged and deployed. Whether the tests detect an incompatible update depends on how much of the application the tests cover, which is unknown.
  - But option A does not merge an update that causes the tests to fail, and no person applies that update until someone notices the failure, so a vulnerability can remain in the production system longer and users' personal data are more likely to be obtained by unauthorized persons. †
    - On the other hand, the update tool notifies the developers when a change request fails, so a developer can apply the update promptly.
      - Then again, the notification requires a developer to act, so a failed update waits for a developer in the same way as an update that requires review.
- [Threshold] The benefit increases with the number of vulnerabilities disclosed in the application's dependencies.
- [Effect on persons] A disclosed vulnerability remains in the production system for a shorter time.
- [Reason the effect matters] Users' personal data are less likely to be obtained by unauthorized persons.
  - But an automatically merged update can contain malicious code that no person has examined, so users' personal data are more likely to be obtained by unauthorized persons. ‡
- [Extent of the effect] The time during which a vulnerability remains in the production system is reduced to the time required for the tests and the deployment. Every user whose data the system stores is affected. How likely the benefit is depends on whether a disclosed vulnerability can be exploited in this application, and that is unknown. The benefit begins with the first vulnerability disclosed after option A is adopted and continues while option A is in use.

Column for option A, after its advantages (titles only; the elements and counterarguments of these entries are omitted from this example):

Disadvantages:

A vulnerability can remain in the production system until someone notices that its update failed the tests, so users' personal data are more likely to be obtained by unauthorized persons. †

Updates that no person has examined can introduce malicious code, so users' personal data are more likely to be obtained by unauthorized persons. ‡

The entries marked † and ‡ are listed in full as disadvantages in the column for option A, and each carries its symbol after its title.
